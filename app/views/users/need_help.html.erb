				</div>
			
			<!-- <h3>Do you really have the power to approve a client?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>In short, not really.</p>
					<p>You will first need to go to Student Life to get actual approval for the client.  If

						have to unapprove the client.</p>

	<h3>Choose Clients</h3>
		<div class="help_accordion">
			<h3>What do I do here?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>You choose the clients you want to sell an ad to.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>What does "Total clients available" mean?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>This is the total number of clients you are able to have at any given time.</p>
					<p>Once you reach zero, you will not be able to select any more clients until you
						either make a sale or release a client.</p>
					<p>To learn how to release a client, go to the My Clients section of the Help page.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>Example Situation</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Here is an example situation on the different combinations for choosing a client :)</p><br />
					<p>Let's first set the scenario:<br />
						1) Your "Total clients available" number is 3.<br />
						2) Your "High priority allowed" number is 1.<br />
						3) Your "Medium and Low priority allowed" numbers are each 3.</p>
					<p>You will then have the option to choose any of the following combinations (plus more):<br />
						1) 1 High, 1 Medium, and 1 Low.<br />
						2) 0 High, 2 Medium, and 1 Low.<br />
						3) 0 High, 3 Medium, and 0 Low.<br />
						4) 0 High, 0 Medium, and 3 Low.<br /></p>
				</div>
			<h3>What do the "High, Medium, and Low priorities allowed" numbers mean?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>An easy way to view these numbers is as a restriction on the "Total clients 
						available" number.</p>
					<p>You can never have more than the maximum number of clients.  However, there are cases when the teacher
						decides to limit the number of clients you can choose with a specific priority.</p>
					<p>If you reach zero for a priority, then you will not be able to select a
						client with that same priority type even if you have not reached the maximum number of clients that you are allowed 
						to have.  Once you make a sale or release a client with that
						priority type, then you will be able to select another.</p>
					<p>To learn how to release a client, go to the My Clients section of the Help page.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>Why are there green, yellow, or white lines next to each clients priority?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The colors are associated with each type of priority:<br />
						<h4>Green</h4>- The client is a high priority client.<br />
						<h4>Yellow</h4>- The client is a medium priority client.<br />
						<h4>White</h4>- The client is a low priority client.<br /></p>
				</div>
			<h3>What do High, Medium, and Low actually mean?</h3>
				<div>
					<p><h4>High Priority</h4>- The client was sold an ad last year (easier to sell again 
						this year).</p>
					<p><h4>Medium Priority</h4>- The client was sold an ad two or three years ago (a good 
						chance they will buy again).</p>
					<p><h4>Low Priority</h4>- The client was either never sold an ad before or was sold
						an add more than three years ago (probably the hardest sell).</p>
				</div>
			<h3>What happens when you click the Choose button?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>This will make this client a part of your My Clients.  You can now try to make contact with them,
						give them a sales presentation, and, of course, make a sale! :)</p>
					<p>When you click on the Add button, the button will go away and a message will tell you that you
						were given the client.  If you reach the maximum number of total clients available, then you
						will not be able to select any more clients until you either make a sale or release a client.</p>
					<p>Also, once you have a client, no one else will be able to grab it.  The only way 
						another student can get a client you have worked on is if you release the client.</p>
					<p>To learn how to release a client, go to the My Clients section of the Help page.</p>

	<h3>My Clients</h3>
		<div class="help_accordion">
			<h3>What do I do here?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Here, you can view sticky notes showing you your active, completed, and released clients that
						show you many points you have earned on each.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>What can I do with Active clients?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>You will be able to record actions (first contact, presentation, and sale) to a client.
						To do this, simply click anywhere within the sticky note and it will take you to the 
						Client Activity page.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>What can I do with Completed clients?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>This will take you to the Client Activity page where you will be able to delete an activity 
						or comment associated with this client.</p>
					<p>Keep in mind:<br />
						1) You can only delete an activity in reverse order by deleting the sale first, then presentation,
						and then first contact (you may delete a comment at any time).<br />
						2) Once you delete the sale, the client will now be considered an active client again.<br />
						3) Deleting an activity that has points associated with it will also delete from your total
						points.
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>What can I do with Released clients?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>This is a reference of what activity you did with the client, but you will not be
						able to delete or create activities with it.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>How do I release a client so I can make room for another one?</h3>
				<div>
					<p> 
						1) Hover the mouse over the sticky note of the client you want to release (you will only
						be able to delete an active client, not a completed client).<br />
						2) Click on the small x that appears in the top left corner.<br />
						3) A pop-up box will appear asking you if you are sure that you want to release it along with a comment
						box where you can say why you are releasing the client (optional).<br />
						4) Click release and that's it!</p>
				</div>
			<h3>What happens when I release a client?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The client will go to your Released Clients section, and you will now be able to select 
						another client from the Choose Clients tab.</p>
					<p>Also, if you had any points associated with this client, you will still keep them. :)</p>
				</div>
			<h3>Why are the sticky notes green, yellow, white, or gray?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The colors are associated with each type of priority (execept gray):<br />
						<h4>Green</h4>- The client is a high priority client.<br />
						<h4>Yellow</h4>- The client is a medium priority client.<br />
						<h4>White</h4>- The client is a low priority client.<br />
						<h4>Gray</h4>- The client is a released client.

	<h3>Client Activity Page</h3>
		<div class="help_accordion">
			<h3>What do I do here?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Here, you can record your work with a client (First contact, presentation,
						or sale).</p>
				</div>
			<h3>How do I get here?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Go to your My Clients tab and click on the client's sticky note that you want.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>How do I edit a client's information?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Click on the Edit this client link located on the top right. This will take you to a form where
						 you will be able to update or edit the client's information (subject to teacher's approval of course).</p>
				</div>
			<h3>How do I record an activity?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>You will need to go in natural order of progression (first contact, then presentation, and
						finally a sale).</p>
					<p>Adit will automatically let you know what your next activity will be through an area labeled
						"My Sales Progress."  Simply click on the checkbox next to the activity you completed,
						add a comment if you have one, and then add the time when you did the activity.</p>
					<p>You may add more than one activity at a time (first contact and presentation at one time).  
						You can do this by clicking on the checkbox next to all of the activities you finished, along
						with a comment (optional) and time.</p>
					<p>When you record a sale, you will need to add the sale amount, page size, and type of payment
						to complete the sale.</p>
					<p>Also, keep in mind that once you record a sale, the client will be added to your Completed
						Clients section.</p>
				</div>
		</div>
	
	<h3>Submit Client</h3>
		<div class="help_accordion">
			<h3>What can I do here?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>You can view unapproved and pending clients, and you can also submit new clients that you wish
						to sell an ad to.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>How does submitting a new client work?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>First, check the pending and unapproved client lists below to make sure that
						the client you want to submit has not already been submitted.</p>
					<p>Then, fill out the form at the top of the page.</p>
					<p>Your newly submitted client will be put in the pending clients list until your teacher approves
						or unapproves your submission.</p>
					<p>If the client is approved, the client will be added your active clients, and you will be 
						able to work with that client.  If unapproved, it will be moved from the pending list to
						the unapproved list, and you will not be able to try to sell an ad to that business.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>Why are there sometimes when I cannot submit a new client?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>If you already have the maximum number of clients that you are permitted to have, you will not be 
						able to submit a new client because you need to have space to add the new client if it gets
						approved.</p>
